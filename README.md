WeddingApp
==========

An android application made for weddings. Its main feature is a photo upload feature. Wedding couples usually have a professional photographer for the ceremony and the reception, but nowadays when everyone has a smartphone, the couple may also want to have the candid and "in the moment" photos taken by the guests. This will usually require the couple to ask their guests to email or share their pictures with them which is a huge hassle. This application will allow you to securely upload photos to a centralised server which will organise all the uploaded pictures for wedding party and the guests to browse through after the wedding.

The application also has several other features:
 - Events
	 - A timetable, which will notify users when important events are about to begin
 - Photo upload/gallery
	 - To upload pictures and view pictures uploaded by other guests
 - Directions
	 - Instantly gives turn-by-turn directions to the ceremony and reception
 - Information
	 - Information about the wedding and things to do around the location
 - Messages/Toasts
	 - Allow users to upload virtual toasts or messages to the couple
 - Call a Cab
	 - Direct links to nearby cab companies
 - Registry
	 - A link to the couple's wedding registry

Acompanying server code will be in another registry.
